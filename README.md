# Math 215 Computational Linear Algebra

These are the scripts I submitted for Math 215 at BYU, computational linear algebra
which is a sister course for Math 213, Linear Algebra. These scripts all recieved full
marks, but I will likely be editing them further to include the needed functions for 
questions asking to generate an output as a variable (you'll see what I mean soon enough). 

## Notes for current students, especially those new to programming in Python

This is widely a reference repo, so I hope that you do not simply copy and paste any functions
without understanding what they do. Also, there are often many routes to go about completing the problems
so I highly encourage taking what I have already submitted and experimenting with new methods. You will
also find helpful hints on the TA help page in Canvas where they explain (and often demystify) the problem 
sets and readings. 

I hope this repo becomes a good supplement for you to feel confident in your programming abilities! 

Tally-ho!
